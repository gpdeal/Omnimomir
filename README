This project is an extension of a simple card generator for use in the Momir Basic format.

The main program takes a CMC value and a set of permanent types and randomly selects a card of the requested CMC and at least one of the
requested types. This card name is then displayed and optionally copied to the user's clipboard.

A supporting program takes an MTG JSON file and cleans it up so as to be read more easily by the main program. In future versions this
functionality will be incoroprated into the primary program.
